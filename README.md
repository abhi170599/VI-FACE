# VI-FACE
A Facial Recognition system for the Visually impaired with a Voice interface

This project is aimed at assisting the visually impaired in recognizing the people around them through facial recognition and a voice interface which can guide them.

The facial recognition system is developed using Siamese Neural network model to implement oneshot learning.
The voice interface is developed using Google's sppech api.
